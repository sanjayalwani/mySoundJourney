### Journey
#### Tabular data
Dive right into your data with a table of the last 50 songs you listened to starting with the most recent at the top. Values such as energy and positivity of the tracks are symbolized so you can get a feel for the numbers behind the music.

#### Dashboard
Take in all the different variables of your listening history in a graphical dashboard. Try and spot something interesting about your listening habits.
