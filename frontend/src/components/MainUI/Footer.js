			<p>
				I have always been amazed at the songs recommended to me by
				Spotify. Looking through their API documentation I saw
				that they track so many features for every single track.
				Features include: positivity, danceability, energy, popularity, acousticness, liveness and more <a>(here)[link]</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				With mySoundJourney I aim to visualize and analyze the numbers behind your music completely using your devices processing power to preserve your <a href="" onClick={(e)=> {e.preventDefault(); openModalK(1);}}>privacy</a> and my running costs. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Privacy is something I value greatly, and it feels like something harder to find on the Web each day.
				I have made this project open source on 
				<a href="github.com/sanjayalwani/mysoundjourney">Github</a> so you can see how it works.
			</p>
			<p>
				Motivations behind privacy
				<ul>
					<li>
						Complies with Spotify's API use terms and conditions
					</li>
					<li>
						All processing and data on the client (your device) saves me server costs.
					</li>
					<li>
						Complies with my ethos on privacy.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				A consequence of this privacy-driven approach is that I will not be able to make deeper insights and models tailored to you.
